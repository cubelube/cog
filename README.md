# Cog

This is a work in progress version control system (similar to Git) written in Rust. Cog is in active development and features should be considered unstable and/or missing.


## Features

- Initialize a new repository with `cog init`
- Add files with `cog add <filename>`
- Commit with `cog commit` (WIP)
## Installation

Currently the only way to install Cog is by cloning the repo and compiling it yourself. This requires the [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/cubelube/cog/
  cd cog
  cargo build -r
```
